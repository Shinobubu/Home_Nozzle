# Home Nozzle (Work in progress)

This is a simple Klipper plugin for using the nozzle and the an endstop to home Z. 
inspired by the Z Calibration project. This is intended for people who still uses inductive bed leveling probes and not a microswitch.
You can also use a flexible potentiometer as a switch providing you hvae a micro controller that opens a pin to HIGH.

Advantages:
+ Allows you to change nozzles with out having to adjust z-offsets
+ Thermal expansion of the nozzle will no longer be an issue.
+ Z Calibration will now just be part of a seldom maintenance cycle instead of having to do it more often
